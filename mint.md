**Mint update as of 11/8/2021**&#x20;

1. We are going to pause the mint on **Wednesday, 11/10 at 10pm est**
2. Once we pause the mint we will be taking a snapshot of current holders&#x20;
3. Those current holders will be airdropped Mango Heroes at a 1:1 ratio. So if you minted 1 or 20 you'll get airdropped that amount as long as they remain in your wallets at the time of the snapshot&#x20;
4. Once snapshot and airdrop is complete we will resume the mint with the remaining supply with the price at 0.5 sol
