# ðŸ¥­ Mango Heroes

![](<.gitbook/assets/Untitled (1920 x 1080 px) (1).png>)



The sole aim of the Mango Heroes Project in the beginning was to simply make Mango NFT art for the Mango Markets protocol.&#x20;

That quickly morphed and evolved into something bigger, something more.

&#x20;You can read more about that here:&#x20;

I hope this documentation is able to capture as transparently as possible everything we've been working on. --Etsploit

The Mango Heroes project started as an idea this year in the wake of heavy regulation taking the freedom away from crypto traders to trade on centralized exchanges without completing KYC (Know Your Customer/Consumer). Out of this our community has seen several protocols crop up to fill the need for a decentralized leverage trading platform. On the Solana we have Mango Markets Protocol that allows you to leverage the speed and low transaction fees of the Solana Blockchain. You can find out more about Mango Markets here: [https://mango.markets/](https://mango.markets)

### So what is a Mango Hero?

We saw Mango Markets as this decentralized "hero" for the crypto community and the first Mango Hero idea was born. Instead of creating something completely new and different we saw a rare opportunity to work alongside a budding and positive Solana project. One of the main goals of the project is to bridge the crypto trading community with the crypto NFT community to increase collaboration and community along these at times parallel lines. One of the first investments the Brain Trust Dao made as a group was to buy a Mango Cap so it is an honor now to work on this project together to bring Mango Heroes to you as something that will be more than a JPEG in your wallet in 5 years. We are working diligently on building out an entire Mango Universe and associated applications.[\
