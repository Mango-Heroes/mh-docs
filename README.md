# ðŸ¥­ Mango Heroes

![](<.gitbook/assets/Untitled (1920 x 1080 px) (1).png>)

The sole aim of the Mango Heroes Project in the beginning was to simply make mango themed NFT art for the Mango Markets protocol.&#x20;

That quickly morphed and evolved into something bigger, something more.

&#x20;You can read more about how it all started here:

This year, in the wake of heavy regulation taking the freedom away from crypto traders to trade on centralized exchanges without completing KYC (Know Your Customer/Consumer), several protocols cropped up to fill the need for a decentralized trading platform option.

On Solana, we have the **Mango Markets Protocol** that allows anyone to leverage (haha, get it?) the speed and low transaction fees of the Solana Blockchain. It also has and has been adding many of the familiar elements of more long standing centralized versions such as limit ordering, stop losses, and advanced charting features just to name a few.

### So what is a Mango Hero?

We saw Mango Markets as this decentralized "hero" for the crypto community and the first Mango Hero idea was born. Instead of creating something completely new and different we saw a rare opportunity to work alongside a budding and positive Solana project.&#x20;

### What are the main goals of the Mango Hero Project?

1. Supporting Mango Markets by advocating and when possible building features that will promote it's growth and success
2. Bridging the crypto trading community with the crypto NFT community to increase collaboration and community along these at times parallel lines
3. Bring Mango Heroes to you as something that will be more than a JPEG in your wallet in 5 years. We are working diligently on building out an entire Mango Universe and associated applications.[\
