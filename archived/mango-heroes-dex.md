# â™» Mango Heroes Dex

The original idea for the Mango Heroes Dex was to run a Serum Dex GUI to support the decentralization of Serum and Solana and to possibly plug in liquidity to Mango Markets. Developments in the last few months have made this a much less valuable project to work on. With the reduction of fees voted by the Serum governance vote and the increasing use of protocols like Jupiter it doesn't make sense to spend the time building this out as the fee capture will be very minimal.
