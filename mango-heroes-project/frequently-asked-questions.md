# ‚Åâ Frequently Asked Questions

### **General**

1. **When can I mint?** Our sale is currently live at our official website Mangoheroes.com and will aim for marketplaces soon. DO NOT connect your wallet to any other website!
2. **What is the total supply?** The Mango Heroes discord community, after polls, decided on a 7,000 mint supply.
3. **How much will it cost to mint an NFT?** 0.5 SOL

5. **Do you have a rarity system?** Yes! Kellz has put in a lot of work to develop this. Future decisions by the community as well as phases and "events" in our project will alter this rarity system as well. See [rarity-catalogue.md](rarity-catalogue.md "mention")

### Discord Specific

    These roles were automatically whitelisted: Green, Red, and Orange mango.&#x20;

    **Green Mangos:** The first 500 that joined Discord&#x20;

    **Red Mangos:** Contest and giveaway winners, and those who invited **3** people to the server
