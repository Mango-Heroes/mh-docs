# ‚Åâ Frequently Asked Questions

### **General**

1. **When can I mint?** Our sale is currently live at our official website [mangoheroes.com](https://mangoheroes.com)
2. **What is the total supply?** The Mango Heroes discord community, after polls, decided on a 7,000 mint supply.
3. **How much will it cost to mint an NFT?** 0.5 SOL
4. **Will there be a pre-sale?** The Mango Heroes discord community, after polls, had decided to conduct a whitelist sale. Any colored mango role received a presale spot (Orange, Green, and Red). Presale went live prior to the public mint.
5. **Do you have a rarity system?** Yes! Kellz has put in a lot of work to develop this. Future decisions by the community as well as phases/events in our project will alter this rarity system as well. See [rarity-catalogue.md](rarity-catalogue.md "mention")
6. &#x20;**Will there be a secondary market?** Yes, we will work with all the reputable secondary markets to ensure safe and effective sales after the mint is over.
7. &#x20;**"Are you guys involved with the Mango Markets team?"** To clear up any confusion we are a separate project team but consider ourselves contributors to the Mango Markets DAO. We have had meetings with the mango core team and presented our project idea at a past mango developer call.

9. **Will the unminted supply be burnt?** No plans for this at this time.

### Discord Specific

1.  **What are the different colored roles?**&#x20;

    These roles were automatically whitelisted: Green, Red, and Orange mango.&#x20;

    Green Mangos: The first 500 that joined Discord&#x20;

    Red Mangos: Contest and giveaway winners, and those who invited 3 people to the server

    Orange Mangos: Those who reached level 10 in Discord by engaging in Discord&#x20;

    **NOTE: All presale roles are now closed.**&#x20;
2. **Where did the colored mango channels go?** We condensed the colored mangos and will soon change to verified-only channels.

### Philosophical

1. **Why are the Mangos different colors?** They are magical beings.
2. **Why doesn't my Mango Hero...look like a Hero?** The term "hero" is vast and heroes can come in all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, etc. There are flashy, public, popular heroes and then there are those that prefer the shadows. The question of morality and "good" is also subjective. Therefore, it is impossible to pin a "look" of a hero when anyone could be one within their own definitions.
